# Commit 1 Reflection Notes

In this commit, I learned how to:
- Set up a basic TCP server in Rust using `TcpListener`
- Handle incoming connections with the `handle_connection` function
- Parse HTTP requests using `BufReader`
- Collect and display HTTP request headers
- Debug errors in the build process including installing required build tools

The server currently listens on 127.0.0.1:7878 and outputs the request details to the console.
